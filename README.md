# KaTeX for Messenger

Once upon a time we had Chrome extensions ([1](https://github.com/MALLER-LAGOON/latex-for-facebook), 
[2](https://github.com/dshynkev/messenger-latex)) that made TeX math rendering possible on Facebook/in Messenger. 
Facebook then [added native support](https://thenextweb.com/news/facebook-messenger-lets-you-write-basic-mathematical-formulae-in-latex)
for LaTeX to Messenger, making the second of the listed extensions obsolete, if not the first. Sadly, Messenger no longer supports LaTeX natively. Both of the extensions mentioned above are now defunct as they were not maintained after LaTeX support was implemented natively in Messenger. Rather than trying to salvage those old extensions whose development I had no part in 
and whose inner workings were a mystery to me, I wrote a Chrome extension of my own: KaTeX for Messenger. As the name suggests, 
it uses KaTeX for rendering, which is currently a better-documented library than the latest version of MathJax (whose docs 
are [under construction](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/api/index.html)).
